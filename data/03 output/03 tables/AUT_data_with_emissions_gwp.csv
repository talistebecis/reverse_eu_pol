"The highlighted rows are those that I used to compute the total reduction figure of 6.1 million tonnes, so as not to double count structural breaks (e.g. the same break captured across ""all GHGs"" and the individual GHGs, or breaks in 2 consecutive years that are likely the same break captured in 2 different samples).",,,,,,,,,
