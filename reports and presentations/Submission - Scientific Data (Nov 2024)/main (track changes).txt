% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
The quantitative assessment of policy instruments aimed at climate change mitigation requires the rigorous identification of abnormal changes in greenhouse gas emissions. We present a new dataset of robust level changes in greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be explained by aggregate socioeconomic fluctuations. Modern methods of structural break identification based on two-way fixed effects models are employed to estimate the size of significant level changes in emissions. The resulting dataset spans information for all OECD countries and all 37 IPCC sectors, ranging from 1995 to 2022. The data unveils large differences in abnormal changes in emissions across gases, countries and sectors, as well as over time. Our resulting data can be applied to a broad range of research questions, including the analysis of the comparative efficacy of policy instruments to mitigate climate change.

\section*{Background \& Summary}

\subsection*{Purpose of the study}
We provide a comprehensive dataset of structural breaks in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for all countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) between 1995 and 2022. Structural breaks are persistent changes in GHG emissions that are not accounted for by economic, demographic or technological development. By controlling for these main determinants of emissions, we seek to isolate the persistent increases or reductions in GHG emissions that are likely attributable to policy and institutional changes. The dataset serves as a resource for a systematic and comparative approach to evaluating the potential effect of (climate) policies on GHG emissions and thus the efficiency of national and supranational mitigation efforts.

Traditional policy evaluation techniques follow a forward causal approach. Typically, a researcher would select a policy of interest, then seek to isolate the effect of that policy, controlling for other socio-economic determinants of the outcome variable. This approach implies that the policies of interest must be selected \textit{ex ante}, and tend to be evaluated in isolation, which risks ignoring the impact of policy mixes. The dataset developed here can be used as the basis for reverse causal policy evaluation, which first identifies significant changes in emissions, then attributes these "effects" to (policy) "causes." \cite{gelman2013ask} The structural breaks in GHG emissions identified and presented in a systematic manner in our dataset can possibly be attributed to policies that were implemented in a period around the break date, as has already been done in a number of studies with more constrained coverage than that provided by our data.\cite{tebecis2023climate,koch2022attributing, yao2022structural} Existing studies have primarily explored carbon dioxide emissions, which is only one of the major contributors to anthropogenic GHG emissions. These studies have also been limited in their geographic scope and sectoral coverage.


\subsection*{Study overview}

Our study provides a comprehensive dataset of structural breaks in GHG emissions for all OECD countries in 1995-2022 for all major GHGs across all sectors. We use inputs on all the gases that are reported under the common reporting format of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), methane ($CH_4$), nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) and fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases). \cite{eggleston20062006} We cover emissions from 23 different gases, including 19 F-gases and an aggregate of all GHGs in terms of $CO_2$ equivalents ($CO_2$-$e$). Emissions are disaggregated into the 37 categories of the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories\cite{eggleston20062006}. We idnetify strutural breaks in all OECD countries, which includes Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Türkiye, the United Kingdom and the United States. Both positive and negative structural breaks are included in the dataset.

The process of identifying structural breaks follows a novel approach based on model selection within two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models.\cite{koch2022attributing} First, the annual panel dataset of emissions of a given gas in a given sector is regressed on year and country dummy variables and a vector of control variables  which includes the gross domestic product (GDP), its square, and population. These control variables account for affluence and population size, the two main determinants of emissions. \cite{hamilton2002determinants} The analysis has been conducted for the full sample of OECD economies and for a subsample including only the EU15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal and Sweden), as these countries were also all subject to similar (supranational) climate regulations over the observation period, being within the European Union (EU).

Significant structural breaks are identified by using a saturated set of possible treatment effects. A treatment effect is a persistent increase or reduction in emissions, having accounted for the controls mentioned above. With this fully saturated set of possible treatment effects, the regression parameters are not identifiable, so we employ a general-to-specific (GETS) variable selection approach to keep in the specification only statistically significant variables (treatment effects). These statistically significant structural breaks are captured in the new dataset.


\subsection*{Potential uses}

The reverse causal approach has already been implemented in a number of studies in order to evaluate the efficacy of climate policies, but these have been limited in their scope of countries, sectors or types of GHGs. Our comprehensive database supports further research in this area, with a much broader scope of applicability. Further, the richness of the dataset allows for comparisons between countries across a range of sectors, a dimension of heterogeneity which has not yet been systematically implemented in literature to date. Further analysis of the structural breaks could identify "role model" countries, from which other countries could learn lessons about the implementation of effective climate policies. The analysis of positive structural breaks (that is, abnormal increases in GHG emissions) has not been explored in the literature hitherto. Further research in this area could shed light on rebound effects or unintended consequences of policies.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Data inputs}\label{subsec:data}

The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v8.0) database \cite{EDGAR_8} provides annual information on GHG emissions by sector, including carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), methane ($CH_4$), nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) and fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) covering the period 1995-2022. Emissions are measured in $CO_2$ equivalents ($CO_2$\textit{-e}), computed using the methodology in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).\cite{IPCC2014} The econometric model employed required data on population and GDP, which are used as control variables. These are sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database. \cite{WB_GDP, WB_pop}

Two different country samples are employed as comparator groups in our analysis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[a)] All EU15 countries: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal and Sweden, and
    \item[b)] All OECD countries: the EU15 group plus Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, Türkiye and the United States. 
\end{enumerate}

The identification of structural breaks in the EU15 sample exploits the fact that EU countries are subject to a set of similar regulations with regards to climate policy, making the regulatory environment for implementing climate policies relatively homogeneous. For instance, the European Climate Law establishes a legally binding commitment for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and the EU Industrial Emissions Directive establishes common guidelines for reducing industrial emissions across the whole of the EU. While such harmonized regulations exist at the European level, countries have the freedom to implement additional national-level policies.

The use of the OECD sample allows the identification of structural breaks that may have occurred across the entire EU15 sample due to the harmonised regulations, while still maintaining a relatively homogeneous sample group, as OECD countries are all market-based economies with relatively similar access to technologies. The two sample groups allow for comparison, while still maintaining a relatively homogeneous sample in terms of countries' ability to decarbonize.

Table \ref{tab:data_inputs} provides an overview of the input data, including countries, gases and sectors in the sample.

\subsection*{Identifying structural breaks in emissions data}

The abnormal changes in emissions are estimated using methods of structural break detection for panel models, with two-way fixed effects (TWFE) and a general-to-specific (GETS) variable selection approach. \cite{koch2022attributing,pretis2018automated,pretis2022discovering} The assumed data generating process for emissions of gas $g$ in sector $i$ of country $j$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
    \log(E^g_{i,j,t}) = \alpha_{j} + \phi_{t} + \sum_{k=1}^{N} \sum_{s=2}^{T} \tau_{k,s} 1_{\{j=k,t\ge s\}} + x'_{j,t}\beta + \epsilon_{i,j,t},
    \label{eq:general_model}
\end{equation}
where $E^g_{i,j,t}$ denotes emissions, 
$1_{\cdot}$ is the Heaviside function, and the column vector $x_{j,t}$ includes (log) population, (log) GDP and (log) GDP squared as control variables. The error term $\epsilon_{i,j,t}$ is assumed to fulfill all the assumptions of the normal linear regression model. We carry out our inference in balanced panel datasets by sector. For a sector-specific panel formed by $N$ countries and $T$ time periods, the most general specification includes $N(T-1)$ potential breaks, with corresponding coefficients $\tau_{k,s}$ on the indicator covariates. We employ the GETS algorithm to perform model selection in the specification outlined above,\cite{pretis2022discovering} and the estimated coefficients allow for an interpretation similar to that of the treatment effect in a difference-in-difference estimator.

We implement GETS using the "getspanel" package in R, \cite{getspanel} using the block search algorithm of the "gets" package.  \cite{pretis2018automated} We calibrate the level of target significance, so as to control the expected false-positive rate of the selected indicators,\cite{nielsen2018asymptotic} and employ three different levels of target significance: 5\%, 1\% and 0.1\%. The use of different target significance levels provides a test of the robustness of the identified breaks, with low target significance levels implying that the identified breaks are likely to constitute large (significant) changes in emissions. Our conservative approach effectively implies that we identify minimum effect sizes, and thus lower-bound estimates of abnormal changes in emissions.

Figure \ref{fig:counterfactuals} presents three examples plots from the "Main Activity Electricity and Heat" sector for a positive structural break (identified in the Netherlands), a negative structural break (United Kingdom), and a time series without any identified structural break (Ireland). The graphs depict also the counterfactual dynamics of emissions in the absence of the structural break, which allow us to visualize the magnitude of the abnormal change in emissions.

% DATA RECORDS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Data Records}

The dataset "all\_structural\_breaks.csv" is available online at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325885. The dateset contains seven columns with details about the structural breaks in greenhouse gas emissions. Table \ref{tab:extract} presents an extract of the dataset.

\bigskip
\begin{center}
    \textbf{TABLE \ref{tab:extract}}
\end{center}

The column "gas" details which type of greenhouse gas the structural break was identified for, and can take the following values: "all\_ghg" is the aggregate of all GHGs measured in $CO2$-$e$, "ch4" is methane, "co2" is carbon dioxide, "fgas" refers to all fluorinated gases, and "n2o" is nitrous oxide. The "sample" column indicates whether a break was identified in the EU15 or OECD sample. The "sector" column corresponds to IPCC emissions category. The "target p-value" column indicates which p-value the break was identified for. "country" lists the country in which the break was identified, and "year" corresponds to the break date. The "coef", "std.error", "t-stat", and "p-value" refer to the estimated coefficient, standard error, test statistic and p-value of the identified break, respectively. Finally, the "break direction" column details if the break is negative of positive.

Table \ref{tab:descriptives_summary} outlines basic descriptive statistics on negative and positive structural breaks by gas, country, sector, year and sample. The mean values refer to mean number of total breaks identified for within each value of a country. For example, a mean of 96.4 negative structural breaks were identified per country across the entire dataset.

% TECHNICAL VALIDATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Technical Validation}

We validate the identified structural breaks using the block search algorithm of the GETS variable selection process. An iterative process selects significant structural breaks to reduce the general model to a specific model, with only statistically significant structural breaks. To ensure a high level of confidence in the identified breaks and a low false positive rate, we calibrate the model with three levels of target significance: 5\%, 1\% and 0.1\%. The conservative significance levels mean that highly significant structural breaks are identified. Further, validation of specific breaks is achieved through comparison of breaks across samples and visual inspection of the model fit with the actual time series of emissions. If a break appears across multiple samples, one can be more confident in the timing of the break. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:counterfactuals}, the fitted models align closely with the actual time series, suggesting that the specified model captures a significant proportion of the variation in the true data generating process.
